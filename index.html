            My name is pronounced Eek-Ball but its ok if you don't get it right the first time. I graduated 
            from Cal State Long Beach with a BA in Political Science. Currently I work part time as an Events 
            Planner. I have been working events before I even graduated and always knew I wanted to be in the 
            field of software development someday. Now, I am currently attending UCLA Extension's Coding BootCamp 
            to become a Full Stack Engineer. I can't wait to learn and grow from this program and start a new career.

            During my free time, I like to workout and hike. I am currently doing a StrongLifts workout routine
             which is 3 times a week and difficult to do. My favorite hiking trail is the Mt. Hollywood trail in 
             Griffith Park. I also like Nintendo video games. My favorite game franchise of all time for me has to 
             be Zelda and the Breath of the Wild game is highly addictive. Other than that, I also love art and design
              and even have an annual pass to LACMA.
